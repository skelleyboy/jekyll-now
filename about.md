I currently live in Bloomington, IN with my wife ([http://stephaniemackphotography.com/](http://stephaniemackphotography.com/ "http://stephaniemackphotography.com/")) and our two rescue pups.

### Drumming

I have played drums  and collaborated in various diy bands since I was a teenager. Here are some of my past projects.
