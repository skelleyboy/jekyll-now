This is a free static blog created and hosted with github.

I followed the simple process here to get started - [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/ "Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages")

[https://app.forestry.io](https://app.forestry.io "https://app.forestry.io") - Makes managing content a breeze.
