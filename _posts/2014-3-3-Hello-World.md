Follow this guide to build your own site.

This is a free static blog created and hosted with github. You can very easily and quickly create your own.

1. I followed the simple process here to get started - [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/ "Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages")
2. [https://app.forestry.io](https://app.forestry.io "https://app.forestry.io") - Makes managing content a breeze.
3. Head over to name silo and grab a domain name
4. Spread the word.
