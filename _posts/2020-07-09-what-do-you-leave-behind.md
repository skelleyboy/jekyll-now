Design gives you the opportunity to put things into the world.

You get to help others every day.

By exploring new ideas and testing them.

You can start small and expand

and leave lasting impact.

**Make something and learn as you go.**

It gives you the opportunity to try something and see how people respond.

1. What can you create in a day that you can expand on?
2. Will it be useful to you and others on your team, organization or at your company?
3. If your company does not have a hack day, make your own and share what you did with others on your team.
4. Feedback is essential!
5. You have the power to expand your skills, be helpful and never stop learning.
6. You can practice solving design problems and getting feedback within your company.
7. You will discover something new.

  
And start you open your eyes to the needs of others.
